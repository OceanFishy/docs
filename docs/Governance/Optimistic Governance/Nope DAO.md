The Nope DAO is a sub-DAO that is able to veto and cancel any pod proposal. It can be thought of as a checks and balances mechanism on the governance "express lane" that are pods.

Any community member can create a veto proposal (there is no minimum threshold) and when 10M Tribe votes in favour, the pod proposal is immediately available to be cancelled. 


If a proposal is vetoed by the Nope DAO, the proposal should then go through the normal governance mechanisms and it is no longer eligible for the "express lane". The proposal will have to go to a full DAO vote.

The Nope DAO is available on Tally at: https://www.tally.xyz/governance/eip155:1:0x6C7aF43Ce97686e0C8AcbBc03b2E4f313c0394C7 .
