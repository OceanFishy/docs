The Nope DAO is a sub-DAO that is able to veto and cancel any pod proposal. Any community member can create a veto proposal (there is no minimum threshold) and when 10M Tribe votes in favour, the pod proposal will be immediately cancelled. 

If a proposal is vetoed by the Nope DAO, it is expected that if the proposal is to be re-attempted then it should go to a full DAO vote.

The Nope DAO is available on Tally at: https://www.tally.xyz/governance/eip155:1:0x6C7aF43Ce97686e0C8AcbBc03b2E4f313c0394C7 .
