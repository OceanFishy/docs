# Overview

The Tribe ecosystem makes use of an optimistic governance model which has four layers:

**1. Tribe DAO**
- The highest level entity and has ultimate control over managing the protocol.

**2. Optimistic governance pods**
- Working groups of community members and protocol experts sitting on a Gnosis safe connected to a timelock. Able to optimistically govern specific parts of the protocol.

**3. NopeDAO** 
- A sub-DAO with a low quorum that is specifically able to veto governance pod proposals.

**4. Guardian**
- An emergency multisig operated by Fei Labs which can take limited safety and security actions in the event of a protocol emergency.


The following pages contain detailed information on these different components of the governance system and how they work together.
