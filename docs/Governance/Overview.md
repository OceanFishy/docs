# Overview

The Tribe ecosystem makes use of an optimistic governance model which has four layers:

1. Tribe DAO - the highest level entity and has ultimate control over managing the protocol
2. Optimistic governance pods - working groups of community members and protocol experts sitting on a Gnosis safe connected to a timelock. Able to optimistically govern specific parts of the protocol
3. NopeDAO - a sub-DAO with a low quorum that is specifically able to veto governance pod proposals
4. Guardian - an emergency multisig operated by Fei Labs which can take limited safety and security actions in the event of a protocol emergency


The following pages contain detailed information on these different components of the governance system, where to see the latest proposals and how to get involved.
