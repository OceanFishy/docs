# Overview

Flywheel is a suite of open source token incentives and governance infrastructure using modern and modular solidity patterns to easily interface with other platforms.

It is built by the [Tribe DAO](http://tribedao.xyz/) using [Foundry](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry) and [Solmate](https://github.com/Rari-Capital/solmate).


Flywheel is completely on-chain and composable, for maximum compatibility with smart contract systems.

For more info, see the [Flywheel codebase](https://github.com/fei-protocol/flywheel-v2).
