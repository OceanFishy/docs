The PCV (Protocol Controlled Value) is the aggregate amount of all the funds held by the protocol on its various [PCV Deposits](PCVDeposits.md). It is managed collectively by all the Tribe DAO token holders, through the protocol [Governance](Governance.md).

Through [governance](Governance.md) proposals, anyone can suggest new "yield strategies" or PCV deployments, changes of sizes or affectations, and if approved, new [PCV Deposits](PCVDeposits.md) will be deployed to implement them.

The movement of PCV between deposits can be performed by any smart-contract with the `PCV_CONTROLLER` role (see [Access Control](AccessControl.md)).

Some pre-approved PCV movements can be triggered by the [PCV Guardian](https://github.com/fei-protocol/fei-protocol-core/blob/develop/contracts/pcv/PCVGuardian.sol), for instance to save funds held on a compromised PCV deposit, or move yield farming rewards to a suitable deposit where they can be delegated to vote in other DAOs.
